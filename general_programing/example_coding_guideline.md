# Coding Standards and Guidelines

Welcome to our repository! This guide provides coding standards and best practices that help maintain a clean, efficient, and consistent codebase. Following these guidelines will help ensure that our code is readable, maintainable, and bug-free.

### 1. General Principles

- **Keep it Simple (KISS):** Aim for simplicity. Avoid overly complex solutions unless absolutely necessary.
- **Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Reuse code and functions where possible to reduce duplication.
- **Single Responsibility Principle:** Functions and classes should have one responsibility. Avoid doing multiple tasks within a single function.
- **Readability over Cleverness:** Write code that is easy to read and understand; avoid overly complex logic or clever tricks.

---

### 2. Code Structure

- **Organize by Feature or Module:** Group related code (classes, functions, etc.) into modules or folders based on their functionality.
- **File Naming:** Use lowercase with underscores for filenames (e.g., `data_processing.py`).
- **Function Length:** Keep functions under 20 lines if possible. Break down larger functions into smaller helper functions.
- **Imports:** Group imports as follows:
  1. Standard library imports
  2. Third-party imports
  3. Local application imports
  
   Use an empty line between each group and avoid unused imports.

Example:
```python
import os
import sys

import requests

from .helpers import calculate_total
```

---

### 3. Naming Conventions

- **Variables and Functions:** Use `snake_case` for variable and function names.
- **Constants:** Use `ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES` for constants.
- **Classes:** Use `PascalCase` for class names.
- **Modules and Packages:** Use `lowercase_with_underscores`.
- **Avoid Abbreviations:** Use descriptive names instead of abbreviations (e.g., `calculate_average` instead of `calc_avg`).
- **Boolean Variables:** Start boolean variables with `is_` or `has_` (e.g., `is_active`, `has_permission`).

---

### 4. Documentation and Comments

- **Docstrings:** Write docstrings for all public classes, methods, and functions using the following format:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """
    Calculates the average of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): List of numerical values.

    Returns:
        float: The average of the input list.
    """
```

- **Inline Comments:** Use inline comments to explain non-obvious parts of the code. Place comments above the code they describe and keep them concise.
- **TODOs:** Use `# TODO:` to mark areas for improvement or future work. Include your name and date for accountability, e.g., `# TODO (John, 2024-01-01): Refactor this logic`.

---

### 5. Code Style

- **Indentation:** Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
- **Line Length:** Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters. For complex expressions, break lines after operators.
- **Spacing:** Use a single blank line to separate logical sections within a function.
- **Avoid Trailing Whitespace:** Remove any trailing whitespace in your code.
- **Empty Lines:** Use two blank lines between top-level definitions (e.g., functions and class definitions).
- **PEP 8 Compliance:** Follow Python's [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guide as much as possible.

Example of proper spacing:
```python
def process_data(data):
    """
    Processes the input data by validating and transforming it.
    """
    if not data:
        return None

    processed_data = transform_data(data)
    return processed_data
```

---

### 6. Error Handling

- **Use Exceptions:** Use exceptions to handle errors instead of returning error codes.
- **Try-Except Blocks:** Avoid overly broad exceptions. Catch specific exceptions and provide meaningful error messages.
- **Logging:** Log error details in error handling blocks to help with debugging. Avoid exposing sensitive data in logs.
- **Avoid Silent Failures:** Do not catch exceptions without handling them or logging the issue.

Example:
```python
try:
    result = divide(a, b)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    logger.error("Division by zero occurred")
    result = None
```

---

### 7. Testing and Test-Driven Development

- **Write Tests:** Write unit tests for all new features and bug fixes.
- **Test Structure:** Group tests logically, and name test functions clearly (e.g., `test_calculate_average`).
- **Keep Tests Small:** Each test should test one thing, and each test file should be under 200 lines if possible.
- **Mock External Dependencies:** For external resources (APIs, databases), use mocks to isolate test cases.
- **Run Tests Regularly:** Run tests locally before pushing any code. Automated tests will also run in CI/CD.

---

### 8. Version Control Practices

- **Branch Naming:** Use descriptive branch names, e.g., `feature/user-authentication` or `bugfix/fix-login-issue`.
- **Commit Messages:** Write clear, descriptive commit messages. Use the following format:
  - **Summary:** Start with a capital letter, use the imperative mood (e.g., “Add authentication module”).
  - **Description (Optional):** Provide additional context if necessary, particularly for non-trivial changes.
- **Pull Requests:** Use pull requests to merge code into the main branch. Ensure your code is reviewed and approved before merging.
- **Atomic Commits:** Make small, self-contained commits rather than one large commit.

Example Commit Message:
```
Add error handling for user authentication

- Adds specific exceptions for login errors
- Updates logging for failed login attempts
```

---

### 9. Code Review Process

- **Review Purpose:** Code reviews help maintain code quality, catch bugs, and share knowledge.
- **Be Constructive:** Offer constructive feedback and focus on the code, not the coder. Praise good work as well.
- **Test Code Before Approving:** Pull the code and test it if necessary to verify it works as expected.
- **Ask Questions:** If something is unclear, ask for clarification instead of making assumptions.

### Summary

Adhering to these coding standards will improve the consistency, readability, and maintainability of our codebase. By following these guidelines, you’ll be contributing to a high-quality, collaborative, and productive development environment.
